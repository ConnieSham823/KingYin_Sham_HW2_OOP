# KingYin_Sham_HW2_OOP
This repository contains a mini webpage created for Skinic Medical Centre, 
designed to help users select their skin problems and view the relevant treatments. 
The project is built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript, 
incorporating modules and Parcel.js as the bundler to ensure a smooth 
development and deployment experience.

## Installation

To run the project locally, you will need to install a few dependencies. 
Simply clone the repository, navigate to the project folder, and run npm install 
to install the required packages. Then, use npm start to launch the development 
server and open the project in your browser. This is necessary because 
the project uses Parcel.js for bundling and serving the application.

## Usage

It's recommended to run the project using the development server (npm start) to take advantage of live reloading and better performance.
